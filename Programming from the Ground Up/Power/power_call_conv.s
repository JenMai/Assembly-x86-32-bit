    # PURPOSE: Similar as power.s (2 arguments and stack for calling convention), 
    # using registers only as calling convention
    # This program will compute the value of
    # 2^3 + 5^2 + 3^0
    #
    # Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
    # so the data section doesnâ€™t have anything.

# PURPOSE: This function is used to compute
# the value of a number raised to
# a power.
#
# INPUT: First argument - the base number
# Second argument - the power to
# raise it to
#
# OUTPUT: Will give the result as a return value
#
# NOTES: The power must be 0 or greater
#
# VARIABLES:
# %ecx - holds the base number
# %edx - holds the power
#
# %eax - holds the current result
#
